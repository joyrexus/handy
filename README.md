Our nascent experiments with the [Leap](http://leapmotion.com).

We're utilizing the device's websocket stream and [Javascript API](https://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs).

Largely inspired by [@syntagmatic's](https://github.com/syntagmatic) [leap-play](https://github.com/syntagmatic/leap-play).

* [D3 API](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference)


## Projected pieces

* Recorder - record, view, and save samples.

* Viewer - view saved samples in various formats.

* Editor - crop saved samples by specifying start and stop points.

* Gallery - view a collection of saved samples.

* Storage - store samples for viewing/editing.

See `record` and `view` for working prototypes of the first two.
